Hey there.

I'm a long time engineer from Tel Aviv, Israel and currently work at [Torq.io](https://torq.io/).
I started my journey as a Windows Internals engineer (C,C++) in the field of cyber security. However, for the past 8 years I've been working at multiple early stage SaaS startup companies as a Backend Engineer.

# 👨‍💻 Work
I currently work as a Chief Architect at __Torq.io__, an awesome startup company that is building a no-code security automation product. Our technological stack is based on Go, GRPC, VueJS and like everyone else we are using the microservices architecture to build our product. I've joined Torq.io right at the very beginning as one of the first employees. I have the absolute preasure of working with some of the team at Torq for the 2nd or 3rd time.
